## Abstract
Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize target classes by
adapting the prior knowledge learned from source classes.
Such knowledge usually resides in a deep embedding model
for a general matching purpose of the support and query
image pairs. The objective of this paper is to repurpose
the contrastive learning for such matching to learn a fewshot embedding model. We make the following contributions: (i) We investigate the contrastive learning with Noise
Contrastive Estimation (NCE) in a supervised manner for
training a few-shot embedding model; (ii) We propose a
novel contrastive training scheme dubbed infoPatch, exploiting the patch-wise relationship to substantially improve
the popular infoNCE. (iii) We show that the embedding
learned by the proposed infoPatch is more effective. (iv) Our
model is thoroughly evaluated on few-shot recognition task;
and demonstrates state-of-the-art results on miniImageNet
and appealing performance on tieredImageNet, FewshotCIFAR100 (FC-100).
